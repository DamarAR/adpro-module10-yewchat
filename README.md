The chat interface is designed using a horizontal flex layout. On the side, there's a colorful gradient sidebar displaying each user in a semi-transparent card, complete with rounded avatars and a hover animation. The main chat section includes a see-through header labeled ‚ÄúChat!‚Äù, sitting above a scrollable message area. Messages appear as white, rounded cards featuring avatars with blue borders, sender names in bold blue, and gray message text‚Äîwith any gif links shown directly as images. At the bottom, a semi-transparent footer contains a rounded green input box that highlights on focus, next to a circular green send button with a paper-plane icon that darkens when hovered over.
